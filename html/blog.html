                        <h3>Our mission at Planted</h3>
                        <p class="date">Monday April 19th, 2021 by <span>Yousra</span></p>
                        <p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Learn when to stop. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. You need the dark in order to show the light. This is your world.</p>
                        
                        <p>The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>
                        
                        <p>We'll have a super time. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Just let these leaves jump off the brush We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>
                        
                        <p>It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>
                        
                        <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You are only limited by your imagination. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. And maybe a little bush lives there. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>

                                <p>Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. We'll do another happy little painting. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Here's something that's fun. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.</p>

                                <p>You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.</p>
