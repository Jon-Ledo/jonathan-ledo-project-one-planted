                <p>Poor old tree. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little
                bit of Sap Green. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We can fix anything. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.</p>

                        when to stop. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>

                    That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being
                    creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being
                    able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>
